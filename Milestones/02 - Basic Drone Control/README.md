# 02 - Basic Drone Control

**Status:** *pending*

**Main Goal:** Establish a connection between the drone and a self-written
script / program.

After completing this milestone, a self-written script / program should be able
to control the drone: Flying from side to side, auto takeoff / landing and
custom waypoint missions.
