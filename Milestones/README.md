# Milestones

The development of this project is split up into multiple parts ('milestones').
Generally one milestone needs to be finished before starting the next one.


## Overview

This list gives an overview of the defined milestones. A directory exists for
each milestone, containing more information about the goals and requirements, as
well as the problems & ideas and the thinking behind achieving the current
goals.

Keep in mind that the definitions of the milestones (main goal, tasks to
complete, ...) can and will change as long as the milestone is still labeled as
"work in progress".

### 01 - Basic Drone Functionality

**Status:** work in progress

**Main Goal:** Create a "finished" hardware- & software setup for a basic flying
drone.

After completing this milestone, the drone should be able to be controlled
manually (lift-off, simple flying manouvres, landing) at nice weather with no
wind or other difficulties.

The drone does **not** have to use GPS to hold the current position or fly
waypoint missions. Other autonomous manouvres like auto-lift-off or auto-landing
are not part of this milestone.
