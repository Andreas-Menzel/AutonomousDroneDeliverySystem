# 01 - Basic Drone Functionality

**Status:** work in progress

**Main Goal:** Create a "finished" hardware- & software setup for a basic flying
drone.

After completing this milestone, the drone should be able to be controlled
manually (lift-off, simple flying manouvres, landing) at nice weather with no
wind or other difficulties.

The drone does **not** have to use GPS to hold the current position or fly
waypoint missions. Other autonomous manouvres like auto-lift-off or auto-landing
are not part of this milestone.

**To achieve the main goal, the following tasks have to be finished:**

1. Select & buy hardware
    - Basic drone hardware (frame, motors, ESCs, battery, transmitter &
      receiver, ...)
    - Flight controller
2. Select software
    - ... for the drone's flight controller
    - ... for the Ground Control Station (GCS)
3. Build drone
    - Build hardware
    - Flash firmware to flight controller
    - Install and setup GCS software
4. Setup telemetry link between the drone and the GCS
5. Tune drone
    - Tune PID values of the flight controller
    - Optimize antenna positions at the ground station and on the drone
