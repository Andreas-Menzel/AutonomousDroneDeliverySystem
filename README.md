# Autonomous Drone Delivery System

Autonomous Drone Delivery System (ADDS) is a complete hardware and software
system to fly autonomous freight pick-up and drop-off missions. It consists of
cargo stations, assisting with autonomously loading and unloading cargo
to / from the drone, as well as the drone itself, which autonomously transports
freight between the cargo stations.

This project is the main part of my bachelor thesis at Technical University
Munich.
